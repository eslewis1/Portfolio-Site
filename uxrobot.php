            <div class="main-text">
                <p>Currently, hard, rigid materials are used in the fabrication of robots. While soft materials have been explored in fields like soft robotics and for silicone humanoid robots, the user experience of these materials has not been explored.</p><br><br>
            </div>

            <p class="main-subtitle"> Solution</p>

        <div class="main-text">
            <p> I explored 3D printing soft and hard materials for a household robot, based on the HELLO ROBO platform. I conducted a scenario-based study with 16 participants. The study consisted of a questionnaire, scenarios of use, and an interview to understand user's preferences and experience. The findings are presented with grounded theory and content analysis. A note will be submitted to CHI'17.</p>

        <div class="main-text">
            <p> I had the participants examine 3 different material robot parts that varied in hard and softness.</p>

        <div class="main-text">
            <p> The user experience was analyzed with scenarios of use. The scenarios were household activities or situations. One example, has a particpant hug the robot while others had the participants carry or move the robot.  </p>
